Helios, lit. 'Sun') is a chemical element with symbol He and atomic number 2. It is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, inert, monatomic gas, the first in the noble gas group in the periodic table. Its boiling point is the lowest among all the elements.\n\nAfter hydrogen, helium is the second lightest and second most abundant element in the observable universe, being present at about 24% of the total elemental mass, which is more than 12 times the mass of all the heavier elements combined. Its abundance is similar to this figure in the Sun and in Jupiter. This is due to the very high nuclear binding energy (per nucleon) of helium-4 with respect to the next three elements after helium. This helium-4 binding energy also accounts for why it is a product of both nuclear fusion and radioactive decay. Most helium in the universe is helium-4, the vast majority of which was formed during the Big Bang. Large amounts of new helium are being created by nuclear fusion of hydrogen in stars.\n\n","_gdeType_elementPrefab":"GameObject","_gdeIsList_elementPrefab":0,"_gdeSchema":"elements","protonCount":2,"_gdeType_protonCount":"Int","_gdeIsList_protonCount":0,"electronCount":2,"_gdeType_electronCount":"Int","_gdeIsList_electronCount":0,"neutronCount":2,"_gdeType_neutronCount":"Int","_gdeIsList_neutronCount":0,"_gdeIsList_elementImage":0,"_gdeType_elementImage":"Texture2D","elementImage":"gui-helium","elementPrefab":"Elements/Helium-element","_gdeType_elementAtomicNumber":"Int","_gdeIsList_elementAtomicNumber":0,"elementAtomicNumber":2,"_gdeIsList_elementPhase":0,"_gdeType_elementPhase":"String","elementPhase":"Gas","elementImageCaption":"","_gdeType_elementImageCaption":"String","_gdeIsList_elementImageCaption":0},"Magnesium":{"_gdeType_elementName":"String","elementName":"Magnesium","_gdeType_elementSymbol":"String","elementSymbol":"Mg","_gdeType_elementAtomicMass":"Float","elementAtomicMass":24.305,"_gdeType_elementDescription":"String","elementDescription":"Magnesium is a chemical element with symbol Mg and atomic number 12.

'stone') is a chemical element with symbol Li and atomic number 3. It is a soft, silvery-white alkali metal. Under standard conditions, it is the lightest metal and the lightest solid element. Like all alkali metals, lithium is highly reactive and flammable, and is stored in mineral oil. When cut open, it exhibits a metallic luster, but moist air corrodes it quickly to a dull silvery gray, then black tarnish. It never occurs freely in nature, but only in (usually ionic) compounds, such as pegmatitic minerals which were once the main source of lithium. Due to its solubility as an ion, it is present in ocean water and is commonly obtained from brines. Lithium metal is isolated electrolytically from a mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride.\n\nThe nucleus of the lithium atom verges on instability, since the two stable lithium isotopes found in nature have among the lowest binding energies per nucleon of all stable nuclides. Because of its relative nuclear instability, lithium is less common in the solar system than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements even though its nuclei are very light: it is an exception to the trend that heavier nuclei are less common.[3] For related reasons, lithium has important uses in nuclear physics. The transmutation of lithium atoms to helium in 1932 was the first fully man-made nuclear reaction, and lithium deuteride serves as a fusion fuel in staged thermonuclear weapons.[4]\n\nLithium and its compounds have several industrial applications, including heat-resistant glass and ceramics, lithium grease lubricants, flux additives for iron, steel and aluminium production, lithium batteries, and lithium-ion batteries. These uses consume more than three quarters of lithium production.\n\nLithium is present in biological systems in trace amounts; its functions are uncertain. Lithium salts have proven to be useful as a mood-stabilizing drug in the treatment of bipolar disorder in humans.","_gdeType_elementPrefab":"GameObject","_gdeType_protonCount":"Int","protonCount":3,"_gdeType_electronCount":"Int","electronCount":3,"_gdeType_neutronCount":"Int","neutronCount":4,"_gdeType_elementImage":"Texture2D","elementImage":"gui-lithium","elementPrefab":"Elements/Lithium-element","_gdeSchema":"elements","_gdeType_elementAtomicNumber":"Int","_gdeIsList_elementAtomicNumber":0,"elementAtomicNumber":0,"_gdeIsList_elementPhase":0,"_gdeType_elementPhase":"String","elementPhase":"Solid","elementImageCaption":"","_gdeType_elementImageCaption":"String","_gdeIsList_elementImageCaption":0},"Albert Einstein":{"_gdeType_name":"String","_gdeIsList_name":0,"_gdeIsList_personImage":0,"name":"Albert Einstein","personImage":"170px-Albert_Einstein_(Nobel)","_gdeType_personImage":"Texture2D","_gdeType_personQuote":"String","personQuote":"\"Imagination is more important than knowledge.\"","_gdeSchema":"person","personBio":"Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics.
