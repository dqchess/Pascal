FullSerializer was used in terms of the MIT license:
https://github.com/jacobdufault/fullserializer#using-full-serializer-in-an-asset-store-package
It was rewritten / extended for Tutorial Designer and put into an own namespace:
TutorialDesigner.FullSerializer. If you want to use the official version too,
that won't be a conflict to this version.
